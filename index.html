<h2>Some news:</h2>
<p>The packages you find here have been abandoned for a long time (almost two years) and the support is coming back. I received few emails (better than none) in order to update and add some functionalities. This will solve the two major issues they have: Documentation and Unit tests.
There are two new packages in the development stage (yea, I know, dev again) but their signatures and working principles will remain the same until the release. This time the code is better comented and documented, therefore any other developer could expand it and even the institutions using those packages could hire developers and start their own custom version. It is MIT, so be free of using it in any thing you need.
<ul>
    <li>
        The first package is <b>cgm_utils</b> (A set of very simple tools and utils). This package is very simple and it provides some tools for enumerations, dictionaries and similar structures. It collects and cleans up some of the structures and functionalities that I used during my studies for several analysis tools; basically utilities.
    </li>
    <li>
    The second packages are <b>Samanta</b> (Simple Account Management for Tools and Applications): This is a Django application that implements several of the user related features I need for the ongoing projects and it will be the heart of the new/final version of MaiteK and Buho.
    </li>
</ul>
How will this affect Buho, MaiteK and Guisse? Buho and MaiteK are being written from scratch using Django as a framework, Samanta will be the Account management application for both, so the support for them will be unique. That means that I'm moving out from PHP. I do not have problems with PHP, it is just that python is a better fit for what I need. Guisse is also being developed but it will remain as a Desktop application but it will have desktop support, but that will take longer.
As you see, the new versions will be all of them connected with each other.

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" 
href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why does 
this page exist?</h3>

<p>Over the years, I have been involved in projects mainly related to education and those projects required software. Therefore, since I like to learn and to program, I decided to make them because I would like to do both at the same time, yea just for the fun of it.
</p>
<p>
Since the beginning, the software has been stored in private repositories in different servers and very unorganized. Now I decide to release some of them (with the authorization of my partners), but just what I think it would be useful for somebody else since it might help somebody and motivate them to make their own fork if they need it or contribute if they want. 
</p>
<p>
All the programs you can find here have the status of "not completely ready, but close". However, they can be used to do what I say they can do, but there might be some bugs. any way, if you need to clone the project, the working versions are in the development ("dev") branches of each project. If you have interest in my scripts, please visit <a href="https://www.github.com/cagonza6/" target="blank"> my profile </a>.

<h3>
<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>MaiteK</h3>

<p>
This is the beginning of what is meant to be an much bigger application/platform for a small community. Once finished, it will contain a bug tracker and a upload/download gallery. Ok, the gallery it is not implemented yet, but it will be soon. The idea of this application, is it easy integration to existing software like forum systems, blogs, or whatever that uses a MySQL database to storage the user information.
</p>
<p> It is programmed using PHP and the microframework Slim 3.

<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Guisse</h3>

<p>Guisse is just a small editor that helps to work with GNUplot and programmed using pyQT for the user interface. It does not provides GNUplot, it does not plot by itself, but it communicates with GNUplot in a very simple way though the OS. Therefore, it does require GNUplot in order to work.</p>
<p> Currently, it works just under Linux. </p>

<span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Buho</h3>

<p>This is a library manager made for a school programmed in Python and pyQT. The database engine runs with SQLite and it is planed to implement a MySQL option too. It still is under development. It is programmed in cooperation with Maite Barros a Chilean Physics Teacher.</p>

<p>the most of the software you find here, are aplications I needed very fast to do something very specific. Therefore, they are quick and dirty solutions that do what I need them to do, it will change to be well documented, written and at least in a beta version slowly, but eventually.</p>
